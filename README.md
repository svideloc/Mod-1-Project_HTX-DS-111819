Let's dive in...

## The Project

Microsoft sees all the other big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they don’t know anything about movies. They have hired **you** to help them better understand the movie industry.

Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating. 

## Methodology 

Some areas you can look to examine are movie genres, movie ratings, budget, social media discussion, or critic/user reviews. Your team gets to *define your own questions* about the movie industry, find the data you need to answer those questions, and then use your knowledge of descriptive statistics and the exploratory data analysis process to try and answer those questions. 

## Data Sources

Microsoft does not have **any** data, so your team should use web scraping and API skills to pull the data you need.  Some great sites to pull this data from include [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/), [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/), [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/), and [TheMovieDB.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US). You are not limited to these sites, and can pull your data from any reputable site. You are encouraged to pull data from at least two sources into this project.  

## Deliverables

Your team must prepare a 5 minute, **non-technical** presentation that gives the CEO insights as to what type of films they should be creating to meet consumer demand. Your presentation should outline the process you went through and use meaningful data visualizations to help illustrate your findings. Your team is expected to use git as a collaborative tool for this project to manage version control and history.

Feel free to use Tableau or Power BI to create your visualizations, although doing some or all in Python is also perfectly fine (you should be able to do both!). We expect the presentation to be a slideshow (Google Slides, PowerPoint, Keynote, or check out [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)). Remember, this is a *non-technical* presentation, and should not contain code, or raw variable names, or statistics jargon, or anything else that may confuse someone who hasn't been in this bootcamp!

## Project Checklist

- Pull data, potentially from more than one wource

    - Establish naming conventions for variables and datasets
    - Clean datasets, *and record the parameters used to clean the data*

- Use Pandas to get useful statistics for comparing films

- Create a shared git repository to showcase your work, containing:

    - A README file listing group members, project goals, findings etc.
    - Jupyter notebooks with clean and commented code, so any independent party could replicate your analysis
    - The original data as it was acquired
    - The final joined and cleaned dataset that was used for analysis
    - Your presentation (or a link to your slides in the README is fine)

- Give at least **two** actionable insights, answering questions like (but not limited to):

    - What type of films make the most money?
    - What should the budget requirements be? 
    - Should they recruit certain actors for their films?
    - How long should their films be?

- Check in with your coach as a group **at least once** to outline your project plan

- Create a slideshow to convey your insights, clearly explaining why these insights are useful to someone on the business side of this!

In the end, your instructor and coach (and strangers!) should be able to view a well-commented git commit history for each element in the git repository. Git commit whenever you make changes, aiming for at least twice a day! 

## Suggestions

- Spend some up-front time diving into data acquisition - what data are you trying to get, how are you going to get it, etc. - then test out your plan to make sure it's feasible before fully committing to it

    - This might be the time to check in with your coach, to see if she has any advice!

- Don't neglect to plan out how you'll be cleaning your data - and make sure you're justifying each step you take in your documentation (code comments, markdown cells or the README)

    - Work together on this, since otherwise you'll both probably be doing the same things but separately!

- Plan out your questions and how you'll be doing the analysis **before** you start coding. This is the place you can likely split up the work, but be sure to keep checking in with your partner - they likely are doing cool things that you may want to use!

- Save time at the end to clean up your notebook and repository, create and practice your presentation, and otherwise cross your t's/dot your i's. 

And remember - you got this.
